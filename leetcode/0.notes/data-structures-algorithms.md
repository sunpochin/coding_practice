* Backtracking:
    * 'all possible paths' hinted in the description.
    * To try all possible paths, the first thing that comes in our mind is Backtracking. Backtracking incrementally builds the candidates for a solution using depth first search and discards the candidates (backtrack) if it doesn't satisfy the condition.


* Binary search:
    * There is 'Sorted array' in the description.

* Dynamic programming:
    * There is 
    * Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
    * It displays the two, necessary characteristics of a dynamic programming problem:
    * Optimal substructure:
