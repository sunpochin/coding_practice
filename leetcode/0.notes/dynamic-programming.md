Dynamic Programming List

Here is a good list of common patterns amongst dynamic programming questions you will come across! This is certainly not an exhaustive list as there are many different variations of questions and patterns within dynamic programming. One key thing to note is that it is not extremely common to get dynamic programming as a question in your interview because of the time it takes, BUT it is still important to practice solving up through the recursive solutions with DP. It's very unlikely you'll have enough time to get through the tabulation solution in the allotted hour time of your interview so it's not necessary to come up with it to pass the interview! One thing to note is that dynamic programming is incredibly challenging to learn and takes a lot of time, so don't spend all your time learning dynamic programming because it is a massive time sink. Prioritize your study time accordingly!

    Maximum Subarray

    Best time to buy and sell stock

    House robber

    Longest common subsequence

    Palindromic substrings

    Longest palindromic subsequence

    Longest palindromic substring

    Longest increasing subsequence

    Coin Change

    Minimum path sum

Here is a great post on common dynamic programming patterns! It is very time consuming to do all the questions, once again only prioritize doing dynamic programming to this extent if you have a solid grasp on everything else!
