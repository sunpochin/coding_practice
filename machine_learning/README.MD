  * 9 * 64 + 64 = 640
    * As shown in Listing 1.4.2, the CNN model in Listing 1.4.1 requires a smaller number of parameters at 80,226 compared to 269,322 when MLP layers are used. The conv2d_1 layer has 640 parameters because each kernel has 3 Ã— 3 = 9 parameters, and each of the 64 feature maps has one kernel and one bias parameter. The number of parameters for other convolution layers can be computed in a similar way. Figure 1.4.5 shows the graphical representation of the CNN MNIST digit classifier.
